### [Auto Auditor](https://github.com/ljeng/c2-education/blob/master/auto_auditor.js)

I wrote a JavaScript program that sorts billing events in chronological order and then uses binary search to find billing errors in business data in C2 Education’s Smart2 system. This significantly sped up the process of auditing business data and improved accuracy.

### [Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1xuv6o85qmvh611/AADWSxHI7Q2jWb4U6QNHhmr2a)

I developed a model based on a dataset of millions of data points that tells us how much each life is worth based on a subject’s species, age, gender, criminal record, social status, pregnancy status, fitness level, and whether the subject is breaking the law (e.g. jaywalking) to use in life-or-death situations where a self-driving vehicle must value one set of lives over another. I wrote a Selenium script that automates simulations based on this model. I ran thousands of simulations on MIT’s Moral Machine, wrote the results to a CSV file, and analyzed them in Excel. I presented this project at the [Recurse Center in September 2016](https://presentations.recurse.com/?date=1474520400000).

### [Design and Construction of a Bridge](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4rur7rilr98wmun/AADQN-pmft81kDrKV-xNcGisa)
Co-authors: Daniel Gologorskiy, Jorge Olaso

We constructed a bridge that was six feet in length and capable of supporting 400 pounds of force. We then ran a compression test on the bridge.

### [Watersports Dock Rehabilitation](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7lbzvcvfqa8hk3/AACi3atw9bN_q9WjSNoEgsR8a)
Co-authors: Daniel Molinaro, [Jake Hughes](http://www.hughesjake.com/), Amanda Yuan, [Isha Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patelisha23/)

Alpha Group drafted a plan to rehabilitate a watersports dock in Boca Chica, Dominican Republic by replacing the concrete and bench, constructing a dock, installing stairs and a ramp, and using a concrete sealer.

### [Flying Dutchman](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o17fburs0mrm2ii/AADdEDQXL72c4lSLCejDMV5Da)

I drafted a three-view hand drawing and AutoCAD drawing of the Flying Dutchman, a former Olympic-class sailboat, from a table of molded offsets.

### [The Effect of Solvent and Solute Polarity on Thermodynamic Stabilization of Solute Molecules by Solvent Molecules](/files/spartan.pdf)
I simulated molecules in Spartan, a molecular modeling and computational chemistry application. I derived a linear function to predict the solvation energy as the function of the dipole moment, polar surface area, and volume of a solute, and the dielectric constant of the solvent using the least-squares regression method.

### [Assessing Gait Impairment Following Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury in Mice](/files/neumann2009.pdf)
Co-authors: Dr. Melanie Neumann, Dr. Yonggang Wang, Sharon Kim, Shwuhey M. Hong, Dr. Mehmet Bilgen, Dr. Jialing Liu

*Journal of Neuroscience Methods*, 2009

To determine the effect of traumatic brain injury on gait function in adult mice, we assessed gait changes following the unilateral controlled cortical impact using a computer-assisted automated gait analysis system.
